The backend is essentially the part of a website that the user doesn\u2019t actually see. It is responsible for storing and organizing data, and ensuring that everything on the client-side runs smoothly. It does this by communicating with the frontend. Whenever something happens on the client-side \u2014 say, a user fills out a form \u2014 the browser sends a request to the server-side. The server-side \u201cresponds\u201d with relevant information in the form of frontend code that the browser can then interpret and display."},{"type":"h2","text":"Database technology"},{"type":"content","text":"Websites also rely on database technology. The database contains all the files and content that are necessary for a website to function, storing it in such a way that makes it easy to retrieve, organize, edit and save. The database runs on a server, and most websites typically use some form of relational database management system (RDBMS)."},{"type":"h4","text":"To summarize: the frontend, backend and database technology all work together to build and run a fully functional website or application, and these three layers form the foundation of web development."}],"title":"Back-End Development (Web Development)","id":"back-en","cat":"back-end-d"}
