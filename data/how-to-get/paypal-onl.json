You can look at PayPal as the pioneer of the online payment platform industry."},{"type":"content","text":"It\u2019s been out since 2002 and is in 200 different countries. Another key benefit is that it sends money to your account instantly \u2013 but only if sent from another PayPal account.\r\nIf sent from a bank account, then you must wait around 3 business days for the payment to process. Also, getting a PayPal account is free and simple to do.\r\nAll you need is a bank account to attach to your PayPal account. Then you have to verify your account by entering the two small payments PayPal makes to your bank account.\r\nBut as with any payment method, there are cons. For PayPal, it revolves around its fees. For starters, the fee for receiving payments (paid by the freelancer, unless the client opts to do so) is 2.9% + 0.30 USD.\r\nSo if you billed a client for $1,000, then you\u2019ll pay PayPal $29.30. Then if you\u2019re based outside of the US, then you have to also pay a currency conversion rate of 2.5%.\r\nIn most cases, banks have a lower exchange rate."}],"title":"PayPal Online Payments","id":"paypal-","cat":"paypal-onl"}
