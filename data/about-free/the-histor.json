You may be surprised to know that freelancing came before the Internet. The earliest appearance of the word \u201cfreelance\u201d occurred in Thomas N.

Both describe a \u201cfree-lancer\u201d as a medieval mercenary soldier who offered his services to the highest bidder. In medieval times, these soldiers were often called condottiere, lansquenet or stipendiaries. An example was Albrecht von Wallenstein who was a Protestant military leader hired by the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II.
